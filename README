* Introduction

ksresamp is an R package which provides a multi-dimensional kernel smoother and some tools for hypothesis testing based on resampling techniques. Although this package is designed with diffusion tensor imaging data as a model data, it may be used to detect significantly different regions for other types of multi-dimensional, large scale spatial data.

* Installation
  - Since ksresamp is not hosted on CRAN yet, you can not install it
    by the usual R function install.packages("ksresamp").
  - You can obtain the most up-to-date source code from the project's homepage at https://github.com/qiuxing/ksresamp or by running the following command 

    git clone git://github.com/qiuxing/ksresamp.git
    
  - You must have R >= 2.9.0 installed, together with the following two R packages: foreach and doMC.
  - Certain generalized bootstrap options (method=sn or gld, see help for pre.post.test and rep.test for more details) depends on optional R packages sn and gld.  You don't need to install these packages to run ksresamp and don't worry if you don't know what generalized bootstrap is: most people don't use them anyway.
  - Since this package contains a small C program, a valid C compiler
    must be installed first.  You also need to install a LaTeX
    distribution and some other command line tools. On a Debian/Ubuntu
    based system, the following command will ensure all the necessary
    tools installed properly

    sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev

    Please consult http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html
    for more details about how to install from a source package on
    your platform.
  - Once all the dependencies are met, use the following command to
    build and check the ksresamp package (suppose the ksresamp
    directory is in your present working directory)

    R CMD build ksresamp && R CMD check ksresamp

  - If everything looks OK, R will produce a compressed file
    ksresamp_x.x.x.tar.gz in your working directory.  Run the
    following command to install it

    R CMD INSTALL ksresamp_x.x.x.tar.gz
